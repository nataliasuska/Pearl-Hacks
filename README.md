## Inspiration:
As the mental health crisis among individuals has worsen over the past decade, studies have shown that the pre-exisitng gender gap in mental health, with women worse affected than men, has widened throughout the pandemic. The lockdown measures of the COVID-19 pandemic have led to an increase in loneliness and emotional decline, on top of the enomrous economic impact on women, which also disproportionately affected womenm with financial insecurity increasing dramatically*.  

We wanted to create an app that combated the drastic mental health effects the pandemic has had on women. We wanted to support women on an empowering level, in order to boost confidence and self-esteem. Affirmations are positive statements than can help someone challenge and overcome their negative or even neutral thoughts. They inspirational messages improve stress management  and can be used to set goals. For example, an affirmation like, "I am strong and powerful, and I will practice yoga for more peace," can be used to uplift and goal-set. So, we sought to incorporate the ability to customize or choose from affirmations and goal statements within the app. 

However, we also wanted to combat loneliness and promote well-being. So, we examined how communication, among even strangers on the internet, could dilute the feeling of loneliness. Furthermore, we researched how women's networks boost  happiness, fulfillment, and general well-being**. So, we sought to create an app that allows women to be paired with other women based on shared interests. Furthermore, we wanted to combine our idea of chats with the goal-setting affirmations. Our chats are designed to match women with similar goals and interests, for example fitness or career goals, so they can motivate and support each other with their daily and weekly goals.

## Challenges we ran into:
### Challenge #1: Beginners
All of us are relatively new to hackathons and coding generally, so it was a challenge to scope out a project we could realistically do with our experiences, while still learning new skills along the way. As we went through workshops, googled nonstop, stack overflowed, gave mini tutorials, and supported each other, we learned a lot along the way.
